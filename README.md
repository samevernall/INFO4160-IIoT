Below is a guide for navigating projects and source files. 
Each Folder is an assignment completed in class with MP's (Mini Projects) being larger in scale.

## HW3: Machine Learning and API demo
  - Source file is "Samuel_Bernal_HW3.ipynb"
  - Goal: Write tutorial for demonstrating concepts of machine learning and APIs
    - train model and explain classification report of test data
    - Read db file and post information to local web server with API
    
## MP1: MNIST Prediction - Web Server App
  - API Source file is "MP1approutes.py"
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP model) build is on "MiniProject1_SamBernal.py"
  - Goal: Create web server which uploads raw data onto server
    - Route 1: Display title
    - Route 2: Read in classifier, use model to predict mnist data, and display raw data onto route
    - Route 3: Display accuracy of model

## MP2: Car Value Prediction Tool - Web Server App
  - API Source file is "MP2_flaskapp.py"
  - RandomForestClassifier build is on "MiniProject1_SamBernal.py"
  - Goal: Create web server to predict car value based on user inputs
    - Route 1: Display title and input fields for user
    - Route 2: Return car value: unacceptable, good, very good

## MP3: ARIMA Forecasting Model
  - Source file is .ipynb file 
  - Goal: Create ARIMA model to forecast number of cars passing through tunnel
